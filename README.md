README

- Write up a document (either a PDF or web page) detailing your project
- including motivation, methods, results, and supporting media (images, videos, datasets).
- This should be sent to me over email.

# Rough Terrain Exploration With a Legged Humanoid Robot

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Introduction

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Methods

### t-RRT

### Hierarchial RRT

### Overall Structure 

## Summary 


### Using and Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
